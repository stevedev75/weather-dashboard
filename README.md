# Weather Dashboard

## Application to generate a weather dashboard displaying current day data and a five-day forecast.

My motivation for this project was to create a web application that used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Moment.js, Bootstrap , Google Fonts, and the “OpenWeatherMap” API to create a dynamic and informative weather dashboard that provides a good user experience. 

I built this project, in part, to showcase my understanding of HTML, JavaScript, and third-party APIs.

This application solves the problem of "fetching" dynamic data from an API (which happens two times in this application).

In this project, I learned a lot -- more specifically -- about APIs and selecting specific data points from them to "inject" into the HTML for a dynamic and seamless user experience.

Please see screenshots to preview UI:
